# Thought Compiler

The goal here is to provide respresentation of my thoughts that are capable of being understood without effort by a human mind. 

A compiler is meant to perform a transformation from a high-level source program understood by a programmer to a low-level target program understood by the machine. This program is meant to serve as a compiler for my journal entries, transforming them from written language to color.

Like a high level programming language, language is something that is understood by those who use it. It requires a certain amount of cognitive effort to engage with a language. Here I am trying to "compile" my use of language to an asssembly-like representation for the human mind, capable of being understood without knowledge of a language. It is in this way that I attempt to treat the mind like a machine, breaking down language to a simpler form that can be understood by all minds.

I was inspired to create this work after seeing ['Color Typewriter' by John Maeda](https://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/archive/works/color-typewriter/). The program itself is a heavily modified adaptation of [Keyboard Functions by Martin Gomez](https://processing.org/examples/keyboardfunctions.html)
